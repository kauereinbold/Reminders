# Architecture Decision Records

Decisions that shape architecture, workflow, or tooling are recorded here so humans and agents share the same memory. Each ADR follows [0000-template.md](0000-template.md): context, options considered with trade-offs, decision, consequences. One page max.

## Process

1. Ideas that need debate start as a GitHub Discussion (RFC).
2. Draft the ADR as `NNNN-short-title.md` with status `proposed`, in a PR.
3. Review and merge: status becomes `accepted`.
4. Superseding: the new ADR references the old one; the old one gets status `superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
5. Add every new ADR to the index table above in the same PR.
